    "Extra cinematic detail": "A hyperrealistic photograph of a brutalist architectural space, based on the provided sketch, captured during golden hour in Greece. The architecture features a series of tall, narrow volumes with broken, irregular concrete walls. The torn concrete edges reveal rough aggregate, rusted rebar, crumbling fragments, and a dusty, weathered texture. Integrated into the brutalist structure are reflective glass surfaces, replacing some concrete sections while preserving the raw, heavy forms. The layout is intimate, with tight frames that focus on a sunlit courtyard where soft golden light streams through circular roof openings, illuminating patches of wild greenery below. Vines cascade down from the broken openings, intertwining with the ruins, while small olive trees and natural stone flooring enhance the Greek atmosphere. A single cat, captured with strong motion blur, runs across the foreground, adding a subtle dynamic element to the otherwise serene and abandoned feeling. Realistic lighting, strong contrast between glowing highlights and long shadows, and fine material detail (scratches, dust, irregularities) dominate the image, creating a deeply tactile and immersive atmosphere."

The rough, pale limestone walls show signs of historical erosion \u2014 cracked edges, exposed stone textures, and small patches of moss \u2014 wrapping around the structure. Large frameless glass panels and minimal metal frames integrate with the old stone, allowing natural light to flood the interior. The angular geometry of the original building is preserved but softened slightly where the ruins interrupt the modern design. The staircase leading to the upper levels is light beige stone with subtle weathering, and small native plants grow in built-in stone pockets along the path. The environment is calm, bathed in bright, natural daylight under a lightly clouded Mediterranean sky. The modern elements \u2014 clean lines, transparent openings, and floating stairs \u2014 contrast elegantly with the rugged ancient stone textures, creating a timeless and grounded atmosphere."

A linear fader with a tactile notched rail and a small toggle switch near the top edge add functional complexity to the layout. The entire left half of the device is shown in frame, filling most of the composition, with soft, warm directional light casting delicate shadows into the seams and around the control elements. The background is a deep, neutral dark grey with a soft falloff\u2014providing strong contrast and visual focus on the beige tones of the device. Depth of field is moderate, with sharp detail across the control panel and soft blur near the outer casing edge. Use a Photorealistic Style. The resulting visual must be sharp, with a high level of detail. A representational image distinguished by its lifelike detail, with meticulously rendered textures, accurate lighting, and convincing shadows, creating an almost tangible appearance.

    "Extra cinematic detail": "A high-end 3D rendering of a surreal, invented flower floating centrally in frame, designed with inflated, vacuum-sealed aesthetics. The petals are arranged in five soft spirals, made from translucent vinyl in layered tones of pale lavender, cloud white, and petal pink, each segment swollen with internal air, creating smooth convex shapes with subtle seam tension and micro-wrinkles at the base. The flower's center glows with a honey-colored, semi-liquid dome\u2014resembling warm resin\u2014with tiny suspended bubbles and a high-gloss amber shimmer. Smaller internal petals appear like ruffled silicone sheets, slightly warped and edged with matte frill textures. Surface details include faint stretch lines, inner refraction gradients, and specks of micro-dust trapped between folds. The background is a soft pastel blend from cream to washed-out lilac, diffused and hazy to give the flower a dreamy showroom presence. The resulting visual must be sharp, with a high level of detail. A representational image distinguished by its lifelike texture, accurate lighting, and convincing shadows. Resolution 1792x1024."

    "Extra cinematic detail": "A high-end 3D rendering of an extreme macro close-up of a stylized tulip, cropped in vertical format to reveal only a partial section of its curving petal surface and upper stem. The visible petals are plump and vacuum-sealed, made of transparent plastic with subtle pastel tinting in creamy white and blush pink, their inflated forms bending light into strong, high-contrast reflections. The material appears slightly stretched along fine seam lines, producing tiny puckers and soft creases, while air bubbles and internal dust specks distort the smooth gloss in hyperrealistic detail. One petal curls inward toward the center, catching a sharp rim of cold white light, while the overlapping edge is soaked in shadow with soft ambient translucency. At the lower end of the frame, a hint of the tulip's matte green PVC stem is visible, faded into blur. Lighting is dramatic: strong side illumination from the right casts deep gradients across the petal surface, emphasizing thickness and material depth. The background fades into a dark chocolate-brown haze with subtle bloom, intensifying contrast and focusing all attention on the tactile complexity of the tulip. The resulting visual must be sharp, with a high level of detail. A representational image distinguished by its lifelike texture, accurate lighting, and convincing shadows. Resolution 1024x1792."

    "Extra cinematic detail": "A high-end 3D rendering of an extreme macro close-up of a stylized sunflower, showing only a partial segment of the blossom in intimate detail, as if seen through a scientific lens. The cropped view reveals inflated petal structures made from translucent golden vinyl, bulging with internal pressure and sealed with visible seam lines and soft tension wrinkles. The petals are glossy and smooth, their surfaces bending light into sharp, specular reflections and subtle rainbow sheens. Only a portion of the flower's central core is visible, featuring matte black nodules arranged in a tight organic grid, each with a slightly uneven, silicone-like texture reminiscent of alien anti-slip pads. Tiny imperfections like trapped air bubbles, micro-dust, and slight warping near weld lines add to the photorealism. The entire composition is cropped tightly, filling the frame with abstract floral geometry while maintaining the recognizability of a flower. The background is an out-of-focus gradient haze in warm sand and soft ochre tones, adding depth without visual distraction. The resulting visual must be sharp, with a high level of detail. A representational image distinguished by its lifelike texture, accurate lighting, and convincing shadows. Resolution 1792x1024."
